	<H2><A NAME="compiling">Compiling a program with INTERNET support</A></H2>

	<P>
	Starting with CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2, INTERNET is provided as a
	separate package, CLC-INTERCAL-INET. The rest of this chapter
	assumes that you have installed that package.
	</P>

	<P>
	INTERNET is a standard compiler extension, so programs must include the
	appropriate compile option to use it.
	</P>
	
	<P>
	The command-line compiler tool,
	<I>sick</I>, automatically enables the INTERNET extension if the program
	suffix includes the letter &quot;r&quot; (for remote - the letter &quot;i&quot;
	was already used to indicate that the program is an INTERCAL program).
	Alternatively, if you are not relying on <I>sick</I>'s guesses and
	are specifying a list of preloads yourself, just add <I>-pinternet</I>
	to your command line.
	</P>

	<P>
	Using the INTERCAL Calculator, INTERCALC, you can easily add INTERNET
	support by selecting &quot;internet&quot; from the Options menu or by
	adding <I>-ointernet</I> to the command line.
	</P>

	<P>
	The <I>internet</I> compiler object, which implements this extension,
	extends the compiler's syntax to include the STEAL, SMUGGLE and CASE
	statements; it also informs the runtime that the program should be
	listening for theft requests, and start a theft server if required:
	this is described below in the <A HREF="#internals">internals</A>
	section.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="using">Using INTERNET</A></H2>

	<P>
	Once you've enabled INTERNET support, using it is a simple matter of
	using STEAL, SMUGGLE or CASE statements as required; in this context,
	IGNORE and REMEMBER are also useful to allow/disallow access to
	your registers from other programs using STEAL and SMUGGLE. Details
	on these statements can be found in <A HREF="statements.html">the
	chapter about statements</A>.
	</P>

	<P>
	Here is a simple example of an INTERNET program acting as a server:
<PRE>
    DO IGNORE @1
(1) PLEASE COME FROM (1)
</PRE>
	It may seem rather pointless, but in fact this program will wait
	for network connections to SMUGGLE its standard write filehandle
	(normally stored in register @1). The filehandle can not be stolen,
	because it is ignored. The second statement is automatically caught
	by the runtime, which recognises an infinite loop when it sees one,
	and replaced with whatever is internally necessary to wait for a
	network connection: in other words, the busy wait specified by the
	COME FROM statement is replaced by an operating system specific
	wait for network connections, which does not consume any CPU until
	you try to SMUGGLE the standard write.
	</P>

	<P>
	A client could do the following, after initialising the .1 register
	to contain the server's process ID, and the :1 register to contain
	the server's IP address:
<PRE>
    DO SMUGGLE @1 ON .1 FROM :1
    DO WRITE IN .2
</PRE>
	what happens here is that one line of input is obtained from the
	<I>server</I>'s standard read, and used in the <I>client</I> to
	assign a value to .2. The server and the client could be in completely
	different networks.
	</P>
	
	<P>
	Note that this example would still work, once,
	if the server did not IGNORE @1 and the client used STEAL instead
	of SMUGGLE, however this would prevent a second client from using
	the same mechanism, because the server would no longer have the
	standard read filehandle available after the first client stole it.
	</P>

	<P>
	We can develop this example a bit further. The server could use the
	system call interface to open a temporary file somewhere on the
	server, and make it available for smuggling to give other INTERCAL
	programs a chance to access the same file - even if they don't have
	access to the computer where the server runs. This program should
	be compiled with both the <I>internet</I> and <I>syscall</I>
	extensions, perhaps by giving it suffix <I>.rsi</I>:
<PRE>
	PLEASE ,10 &lt;- #18
	DO ,10 SUB  #1 &lt;- #95
	DO ,10 SUB  #2 &lt;- #91
	DO ,10 SUB  #3 &lt;- #93
	PLEASE ,10 SUB  #4 &lt;- #95
	DO ,10 SUB  #5 &lt;- #95
	DO ,10 SUB  #6 &lt;- #80
	DO ,10 SUB  #7 &lt;- #92
	PLEASE ,10 SUB  #8 &lt;- #86
	DO ,10 SUB  #9 &lt;- #91
	DO ,10 SUB #10 &lt;- #93
	DO ,10 SUB #11 &lt;- #95
	PLEASE ,10 SUB #12 &lt;- #95
	DO ,10 SUB #13 &lt;- #69
	DO ,10 SUB #14 &lt;- #65
	DO ,10 SUB #15 &lt;- #74
	PLEASE ,10 SUB #16 &lt;- #94
	DO ,10 SUB #17 &lt;- #65
	DO ,10 SUB #18 &lt;- #74
	DO :10 &lt;- #117
(666)	PLEASE .10 &lt;- #3
	DO IGNORE @10
(1)	DO COME FROM (1)
</PRE>
	The first part, from the start to the line with label (666),
	opens a file <CODE>/tmp/server</CODE> for reading and writing;
	the file name is stored in ,10 and the required access mode
	in :10, then system call #3 does the rest. The file will be
	associated with class variable @10. All the server has to do
	at this point is IGNORE @10 and wait for it to be smuggled.
	</P>

	<P>
	A client could SMUGGLE @10 and just do normal file operations
	on it (using READ OUT, WRITE IN, and system call #4 and #5
	to perform seeks). Any changes made to the underlying file
	will be visible to other clients, as well as any user on the
	server computer who has access to the underlying file.
	The implementation of the client is left as an exercise to
	the reader.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="internals">Internals</A></H2>

	<P>
	This section will document the underlying protocol used to
	STEAL and SMUGGLE variables, as well as executing CASE statements;
	it will also show how programs written in other languages can
	communicate with INTERCAL programs using the INTERNET.
	</P>

	<P>
	It's just unfortunate that this section hasn't been written yet.
