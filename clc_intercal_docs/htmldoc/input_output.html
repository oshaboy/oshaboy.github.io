	<H2>... Input/Output</H2>

	<P>
	We agree with the designers of C-INTERCAL that the I/O capabilities of
	INTERCAL-72 are insufficient. However, we don't agree with their implementation
	so we shamelessly go and do something entirely incompatible. However, if you
	select the <I>ick</I> compiler for CLC-INTERCAL you get back their I/O behaviour.
	</P>

	<P>
	Table of contents:
	<UL>
	    <LI><A HREF="index.html">Parent directory</A>
	    <LI><A HREF="#numeric">Numeric I/O</A>
	    <LI><A HREF="#alphanumeric">Alphanumeric I/O</A>
	    <LI><A HREF="#binary">Binary I/O</A>
	    <LI><A HREF="#class">Class I/O</A>
	</UL>
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="numeric">Numeric I/O</A></H2>

	<P>
	This is the standard INTERCAL-72 I/O. It is used with numeric variables
	(one spot or two spots).
	</P>

	<P>
	On input, one line is read and its contents must be a sequence of digits
	spelled out in full in a selection or popular languages, for example
	"ONE THREE TWO ONE ZERO" (English for 13210) or "COIG CEITHIR TRI" (Scottish
	Gaelic for 543). Spaces between digits are ignored.
	</P>

	<P>
	On output, butchered Roman numerals are used. However, we differ from
	INTERCAL-72 slightly in that we use backslashes before numerals to multiply
	them by 1,000,000 - however the actual format of the Roman numerals is
	controlled by the compiler you use: if it is <I>sick</I>, you get the
	backslashes; if it is <I>ick</I> or <I>1972</I>, you get the overline
	like C-INTERCAL does; you can also write your own compiler (or modify
	an existing one) and have another one of the seven or eight formats available.
	</P>

	<P>
	For example, 1,234,567,890 is written
<PRE>
	\M\C\C\X\X\X\I\VdlxviiDCCCXC
</PRE>
	by a program compiled with <I>sick</I> or
<PRE>
	________
	MCCXXXIVdlxviiDCCCXC
</PRE>
	by a program compiled with <I>ick</I>.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="alphanumeric">Alphanumeric I/O</A></H2>

	<P>
	This is the kind of input/output the compiler itself uses to read the program
	source and produce program listings. It applies to 16 bit arrays (tails),
	which must be dimensioned. Multidimensional arrays are "flattened".
	</P>

	<P>
	On input, text is obtained from the next line, and it is converted to
	an extended Baudot code. This is essentially the same as standard Baudot,
	except that selecting "letters" when you are already in "letters" will cause
	a shift to lowercase, and selecting "figures" when you are already in
	"figures" causes a shift to other symbols. See <A HREF="charset.html">the
	chapter on Character Sets</A> for a complete description of extended Baudot.
	Please note that the insertion of shift codes means that the Baudot code
	can be as much as three times as long as the original ASCII, so you must
	dimension your array accordingly.
	</P>

	<P>
	On output, extended Baudot is converted to ASCII and sent to the virtual
	line printer.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="binary">Binary I/O</A></H2>

	<P>
	This is the simplest, yet most powerful, form of input/output. It applies
	to 32 bit arrays, which must be dimensioned. Multidimensional arrays are
	"flattened".
	</P>

	<P>
	The input is assumed to be a stream of bytes, which is not interpreted in
	any way. The number of bytes written in from the input is the same as the
	size of the array specified. To compute the data to store in the array, a
	simple algorithm is applied to every pair of consecutive elements. Since
	this would give one less element, a #172 is inserted at the start. If the
	two numbers in a pair are in <CODE>.1</CODE> (left) and <CODE>.2</CODE>
	(right), the following fragment produces the value to be stored and leaves
	it in <CODE>:1</CODE>
<PRE>
DO :1 &lt;- '.2~.1'&#162;"'"&#165;'#65535&#162;.2'"~"#0&#162;#65535"'~'"&#165;'#65535&#162;.1'"~"#0&#162;#65535"'"
</PRE>
	</P>

	<P>
	We know it's an insult to the reader's intelligence to explain what it does,
	but maybe somebody is in a hurry and doesn't have the two milliseconds to parse
	that, so here it goes: the result is obtained by computing two numbers and
	interleaving them. The first number computed is the second input element
	selected by the first input element (<CODE>.2~.1</CODE>). The second number
	computed is the same selection but applied to the bit-complement of the two
	input numbers. Before applying the algorithm, the numbers are extended from
	8 to 16 bits by padding them with a random value. It is clear that the result
	has all the bits of the corresponding input value, permuted in a predictable
	order, so all the information is there.
	</P>

	<P>
	A value of zero is inserted to indicate end-of-file. The padding is guaranteed
	to have at least one bit set, so the values stored for any input value is never
	zero.
	</P>

	<P>
	For output, the same algorithm is applied in reverse, except that zeros are
	skipped. If you need to use a value zero, pad it to 32 bits with ones. The
	current implementation does not check that the padding is sufficiently random,
	although this might well change in future.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="class">Class I/O</A></H2>

	<P>
	If you use a class name (for example, <CODE>@1</CODE>) for I/O, nothing gets
	actually input or output by the class. However, class registers have associated
	filehandles and mentioning the class instructs the runtime to use the filehandle
	on the current WRITE IN or READ OUT statement. For example:
<PRE>
    DO READ OUT .1 + @3 + .2 + @2 + .3
</PRE>
	produces the value of .1 on the standard read filehandle (the default
	filehandle for READ OUT), then the value of .2 on the standard splat#
	filehandle (@3), finally .3 back on the standard read (@2).
	</P>

	<P>
	The runtime system predefines a small number of filehandles:
	<UL>
	    <LI>@1 - standard write; the default for WRITE IN
	    <LI>@2 - standard read; the default for READ OUT
	    <LI>@3 - standard splat; error messages go here
	    <LI>@7 - null filehandle; if used in WRITE IN, always
	    returns an end-of-file condition; if used in READ OUT,
	    discards anything you send to it
	    <LI>@9 - trace filehandle; this is only available if
	    tracing is enabled
	</UL>
	</P>

	<P>
	When running as a standalone program, or from inside the command-line
	compiler tool, @1 corresponds to the system standard input, @2
	to the system standard output and @3 to the system standard error;
	if tracing is enabled, @9 corresponds to the standard error, unless
	the user has specified <I>--stdtrace=FILE</I> on the command line,
	in which case @9 refers to that file.
	</P>

	<P>
	When running inside the calculator, these filehandles are mapped to
	something appropriate for the user interface in use. Usually, @2
	and @3 send their output to the calculator's display, @9 stores the
	output separately (use the "trace" entry from the "Windows" menu to
	see it) and @1 causes a dialog to pop up and asking the user to type
	something.
	</P>

	<P>
	The <A HREF="syscall.html">system call interface</A> allows to
	open files and TCP sockets and associate them with filehandles.
	</P>

	<P>
	Note that if a program steals a class register from another program,
	it will use the corresponding filehandle as well.
	</P>
