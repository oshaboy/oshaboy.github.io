	<H2><A NAME="compiling">Compiling a program with extensions</A></H2>

	<P>
	Some program syntax or behaviour is available by including a
	compiler extension. A program using such extensions must use the
	appropriate mechanism to load them.
	</P>

	<P>
	The command-line compiler tool, <I>sick</I>, determines which
	extensions are required from the program suffix: in general,
	each letter in the suffix enables an extension. Alternatively,
	if you are not relying on sick's guesses and are specifying
	a list of preloads yourself, just add <I>-pextension-name</I>
	to your command line as many times as necessary.
	</P>

	<P>
	Using the INTERCAL Calculator, INTERCALC, you can add extensions
	by listing them in the command like (with <I>-oextension-name</I>),
	or by enabling or disabling them using the Options menu.
	</P>

	<P>
	Extensions are implemented as special compiler objects, which are
	designed to run in the context of your program just before the
	program itself. The kind of things extensions can do is extending
	the compiler, changing internal registers, or, in some cases,
	use some undocumented features of the runtime system.
	</P>

       <H2><A NAME="list">List of available extensions</A></H2>

       <P>
       In the following list, the extension name is the one you find in
       the calculator's Options menu, which is also the name you use on
       the command line to both <I>sick</I> and <I>intercalc</I>. The
       letter is the suffix letter which causes loading of the extension.
       </P>

       </TABLE>

       <P>
       Since CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-2, the <i>internet</i> extension is
       only available if the optional package CLC-INTERCAL-INET has
       been installed.
       </P>

       <P>
       When used in a suffix, the letter "t" also changes the default
       compiler to <I>ick</I>: this is for compatibility with the old
       <I>thick</I> compiler, or with <I>ick</I> with thread support. Use
       <I>.clcti</I> as a suffix to <I>use</I> sick with threads.
       </P>

       <P>
       The <I>trace</I> extension does not correspond to a suffix letter;
       normally one does not enable tracing at compile time, but rather
       uses the <I>--trace</I> command-line option when running the
       program. This option is available in the command-line compiler
       tool, <I>sick</I>, as well as in all executable programs produced
       by the compiler. The calculator offers the <I>trace</I> option in
       its Options menu and in its command line, to allow tracing to be
       enabled and disabled as required.
       </P>
