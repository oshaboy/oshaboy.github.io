	<P>
	A quantum computer differs from a classical computer because it allows
	binary values to be "0" and "1" at the same time. At present, quantum
	computers are not generally available, but this does not mean that you
	cannot develop programs for them. It just means that as soon as they
	will be available, you'll have the software for them. And INTERCAL will
	be the first language available for them.
	</P>

	<P>
	A quantum computer will usually have a limited number of quantum bits
	(binary values), the rest being classical, one-valued, bits. When a
	program executes on a quantum computer, some of its data can have multiple
	values because it includes quantum bits, but most of the data will just
	have one value.
	</P>

	<P>
	Here's a simple example: an equation (depending on a
	parameter) admits a large number of solutions, say sixtyfour. A program
	determines whether one of these solution falls between 0 and 1, and prints
	this solution. If there are several solutions between 0 and 1, it is
	enough to print one of them. To complicate the matters further, somebody
	has written algorithms to obtain the 64 solutions. However, they are
	all different from each other and very time-consuming.
	</P>

	<P>
	A classical program would compute the first solution, check if it is between
	0 and 1, if it is print it and stop, otherwise compute the second one etc.
	The worst case is to compute all 64 solutions. The average can be as low as
	computing 32 of them, but could be more than that, depending on how often a
	value of the parameters causes all solutions to be outside the interval
	[0,1].
	</P>

	<P>
	A quantum program would include a second parameter: the index of the
	desired solution. For example, it could store pointers to the code to
	compute each solutions in an array, and look it up using this index. Then
	execute it and check if the solution is between 0 and 1. If we could know
	in advance which is the value to assign to this index, the program would
	be 32 to 64 times faster than the classical one. And here's how to do it:
	the index can be stored in a 6 bit register. Make that 6 quantum bits, so
	each one of them can be symultaneously 0 and 1. As a result, the computer
	would symultaneously compute 64 solutions for the price of 1.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="intercal">Quantum INTERCAL</A></H2>

	<P>
	Quantum INTERCAL lets the programmer store the IGNORE status of a register.
	and the ABSTAIN status of a statement in a quantum bit. Examples:
<PRE>
	PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM (1) WHILE REINSTATING IT
	DO IGNORE .1 WHILE REMEMBERING IT
	DO REMEMBER .1 + .2 WHILE IGNORING THEM
	PLEASE REINSTATE COMING FROM + NEXTING WHILE ABSTAINING FROM THEM
</PRE>
	These will assign both values (IGNORE/REMEMBER and ABSTAIN/REINSTATE) to
	the appropriate bit. As a result of this, the program might continue executing
	completely different things, for example:
<PRE>
	DO REMEMBER .1
	DO .1 &lt;- #0
	DO IGNORE .1 WHILE REMEMBERING IT
(15)	DO .1 &lt;- #15
	PLEASE REMEMBER .1
	DO READ OUT .2
	DO GIVE UP

	PLEASE COME FROM .1
	DO READ OUT .3
	DO GIVE UP
</PRE>
	Will the program READ OUT .2 or .3? Both! after executing the line with label
	(15), the value of .1 will be both #15 and #0 (because the register is being
	IGNOREd and REMEMBERed at the same time). Which means that the program will
	continue with the next instruction (because .1 is #0) but also continue after
	the COME FROM (because .1 is #15).
	</P>

	<P>
	One point to note: the program READs OUT both .2 and .3, but we do
	not know in which order. The two READ OUT statements cannot be executed at
	the same time (because they lock the standard output while they are executed),
	but there is nothing in the program which decides who goes first. If it is
	important, you can do something like checking the value of a non-quantum
	variable and have one of the two potential execution path modifying it when
	the other one waits for the modification. For example:
<PRE>
	DO REMEMBER .1 + .4
	DO .1 &lt;- #0
	DO .4 &lt;- #16
	DO IGNORE .1 WHILE REMEMBERING IT
(15)	DO .1 &lt;- #15
	PLEASE REMEMBER .1
	DO READ OUT .2
	DO .4 &lt;- #0
	DO GIVE UP

	PLEASE COME FROM .1
(16)	DO .1 &lt;- .4
	DO READ OUT .3
	DO GIVE UP
</PRE>
	What happens now is that the program always READs OUT .2 and then .3 - this
	is because initially .4 is #16, so when the line with label (16) is reached,
	if .4 is still #16 the program will loop. Meanwhile, the program is also
	executing the READ OUT .2 and eventually will reset .4 to #4 - at which
	point it will get out of the loop and READ OUT .3
	</P>

	<P>
	Beginning with CLC-INTERCAL 0.05, there are two new statements which can
	generate quantum bits: CONVERT and SWAP. These allow a program to modify
	its own semantics at runtime, while leaving it unchanged. The syntax is
	something like:
<PRE>
	DO CONVERT CONVERT STATEMENT TO STATEMENT TO
		   SWAP STATEMENT AND STATEMENT
	   WHILE LEAVING IT UNCHANGED
</PRE>
	This means that next time the program executes a CONVERT, it will
	(symultaneously) execute a CONVERT (as if this CONVERT had not been
	executed) and a SWAP (because this CONVERT has also been executed).
	A similar abomination can be obtained with SWAP:
	</P>

<PRE>
	DO SWAP STASH REGISTER LIST AND IGNORE REGISTER LIST
	   WHILE LEAVING THEM UNCHANGED
</PRE>

	<P>
	What happens next time you STASH something away? Well, it will STASH
	it as normal, but it will also IGNORE it. Do not confuse the above with:
<PRE>
	DO SWAP STASH REGISTER LIST AND IGNORE REGISTER LIST
	   WHILE REMEMBERING IT
</PRE>
	which is a classical SWAP, which happens to have a quantum IGNORE as
	one of its arguments.
	</P>

	<P>
	CLC-INTERCAL 1.-94.-4 and newer allows any statement to be made quantum
	statements, with the exception of comments and READ OUT. This is
	actually implemented by letting the statement run to completion, and
	then undoing its effects while not undoing them. In most cases this
	is the same as executing the statements while not executing them,
	however READ OUT cannot be handled this way - once the output has
	been observed, we cannot undo that. WRITE IN is fine, as the undoing
	just restores the registers to the values they had before the input,
	it does not put the input back.
	</P>

	<H2><A NAME="emulator">Emulation on classical computers</A></H2>

	<P>
	As it can be seen from the above examples, a Quantum INTERCAL program
	effectively behaves like a multithreaded program in which some of the
	registers are shared between threads, while others are private to each
	thread. The private registers are the ones which participate in a quantum
	IGNORE or REMEMBER. More precisely, all registers start as shared. When
	a quantum IGNORE or REMEMBER is executed, the program acts as if it
	started another thread, with the variables involved copied to a private
	area of each thread, but with complementary IGNORE state. If the quantum
	statement was an ABSTAIN or REINSTATE, a similar thing happens except
	that no registers are made private to the threads.
	</P>

	<P>
	This picture suggests how to emulate this behaviour on a classical
	computer, using threads. The compiler will notice that this emulation
	is required if you compile a quantum program on a classical computer,
	and automatically includes the necessary code.
