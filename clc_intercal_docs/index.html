	<P>
	CLC-INTERCAL was first released as an April fool joke on April 1st,
	1999. The idea behind the release was to provide a new INTERCAL
	compiler which could be used as a test-bed for new language ideas,
	provided one could justify such ideas with the fundamental INTERCAL
	philosophy of &quot;doing things differently&quot;.
	</P>

	<P>
	Some features of C-INTERCAL or INTERCAL-72 were thought to be too
	&quot;normal&quot;, so support for them was made optional. In the
	current version (1.-94.-2 at the time of writing), such optional
	features can be enabled by providing command-line options to the
	compiler tool (see the
	<A HREF="sick.html">chapter about the command-line compiler tool</A>),
	or by using the appropriate menus in the calculator (see the
	<A HREF="intercalc.html">chapter about the INTERCAL calculator</A>).
	The reference manual
	will indicate which features are optional and which option enables
	them. For example, CLC-INTERCAL has always considered NEXT to
	be an obsolete statement, being just a standard subroutine call,
	and one enables it by selecting the next option (or by using the
	ick compatibility mode, which automatically enables this option).
	</P>

	<P>
	Other optional features are experimental language extensions, or
	else extensions which, it was felt, are above and beyond the call
	of insanity, for example the ability to use computed statement
	labels or the &quot;COME FROM gerund&quot; statement. See
	<A HREF="extensions.html">the chapter about compiler extensions
	and optional features</A>.

	<P>
	The official sources for CLC-INTERCAL will be normally hosted on
	<a href=http://intercal.freeshell.org">intercal.freeshell.org</a>;
	there is normally a mirror using my ISP's servers, see
	<A HREF="http://intercal.freeshell.org/download/">the CLC-INTERCAL download page</A>.
	A Debian package for CLC-INTERCAL is provided by Mark Brown, usually at the same
	time as the official sources, or very soon after. See the
	<A HREF="http://packages.debian.org/clc-intercal">Debian package description</A>
	for more details. Packages for other operating systems and/or
	distributions may be made available in future. Watch this space.
